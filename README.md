## James P's GitHub Page

Hi, I'm James Pupalaikis! I am a 23 year old physics graduate who wants to break into the world of data science, 
machine learning, and model building. I am hoping that this page can serve as a repository showcasing and saving
whatever coding or data-related work I do in my free time. If you've any questions, feel free to reach out to 
me jamespupalaikis@gmail.com, if you aren't a scammer or anything like that.
