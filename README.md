## James P's GitHub Page

Hi, I'm James Pupalaikis! I am a 24 year old physics graduate who loves data, coding, and machine learning!
This page serves as a repository showcasing and saving whatever coding or data-related work I do in my free time. 
Someday, I am going to work in machine learning/AI, at which point, my journey will be nicely documented here. 
If you've any questions, feel free to reach out to me at jamespupalaikis@gmail.com, if you aren't a scammer or anything like that.
