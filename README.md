## James P's GitHub Page

Hi, I'm James Pupalaikis! I am a 23 year old physics graduate who wants to break into the world of data anlysis, 
specifically focusing on machine lerning and deep learning techniques. I am hoping that this page can serve as 
evidence of my ever-growing capabilities for programming, web automation, data science, machine learning/computer 
vision, and more! As of now it could use some formatting, but if you've any questions, feel free to reach out to 
me jamespupalaikis@gmail.com!
